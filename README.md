[Sunglasses or umbrella?](https://tinevancorenland.github.io/weather-app/)

Raf and Tine created a weather app. This is an original Swiggenland creation.
Not licenced, free for all to use.

**How do I use it?**

Simple...

1. Click on the 'sunglasses or umbrella' link.
2. Type in the name of the city of which you wish to know the weather.
3. Click on the button.
4. View the results.
5. Dress accordingly, pack your bags and go to your place of choice.

As of 6/7/2019, Tine will be found in the Ard√®che. Hardworking Raf will be working extra time and saving up to go to all places that he has yet to visit...

**Important** tip before going on holiday.
Please do not forget to check the weather before going. You do not want to be standing in a thunderstorm, wearing your beachwear do ya?
