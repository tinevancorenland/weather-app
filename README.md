Raf and Tine created a weather app. This is an original Swiggenland creation.
Not licenced, free for all use.

**How to use?**
Type in the name of the city of which you wish to know the weather.
Dress accordingly, pack your bags and go to your place of choice.

As of 6/7/2019, I will be found in the Ard√®che. Hardworking Raf will be working extra time and saving up to go to all places that he has yet to visit.

In case you are loking for travel advice... Tokyo turns out to be tha place to be. Nantes (Fr) is a bit closer to Belgium and also very worthy of a visit. Contact us for more tips.

Please do not forget to check the weather before going. You do not want to be standing in a thunderstorm, wearing your beachwear do ya?
